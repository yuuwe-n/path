# TODO

we need a way to see how many encoder counts per section,
thus we need to meausre encoder counts, and the output them

we have the measured counts, now we need to decide how to output

DATA\_COUNT = 13000

64KB of memory
Sketch uses 44720 bytes (17%) of program storage space. Maximum is 262144 bytes.
Global variables use 60312 bytes (92%) of dynamic memory, leaving 5224 bytes for local variables. Maximum is 65536 bytes.
Low memory available, stability problems may occur.

ERROR.h

idk if i need to use a long for the weighted sum
why do i get values like 4000, test this with output thing later
